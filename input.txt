Beethoven was the grandson of Lodewijk van Beethoven (1712–73), a musician who came from Mechelen in present-day Belgium who moved at the age of twenty to Bonn. Lodewijk van Beethoven was employed as a bass singer at the court of the Elector of Cologne, eventually rising to become Kapellmeister. Lodewijk van Beethoven had one son, Johann (1740–1792), who worked as a tenor in the same musical establishment, and gave lessons on piano and violin to supplement his income. Some time after 1779, Beethoven began his studies with his most important teacher, Christian Gottlob Neefe, who was appointed the Court's Organist in that year in Bonn. Lodewijk van Beethoven stayed in Cologne from 1779 to 1781.
